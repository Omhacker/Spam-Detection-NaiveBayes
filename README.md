# Spam vs Ham Message Classifier

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This is a simple project where I built a machine learning model to classify messages as **spam** or **ham** (not spam). Itâ€™s based on a classic algorithm called **Naive Bayes** and uses Python along with some popular libraries like scikit-learn.

I created this project to get hands-on experience with the basics of data science â€” from loading data, cleaning and preprocessing text, to training a model and testing its accuracy. It was a great way to understand how text data can be transformed into numbers and then used to predict whether a message is spam or not.

## How to run this project

1. You can run the notebook directly on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/):

   [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Bc5my6aMpXkYTGwF3A_E8a6yY9pQww0A?authuser=1#scrollTo=KlQEFmpHo2jT)

2. Or, clone this repository and open the notebook locally if you prefer:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Omhacker/Spam-Detection-NaiveBayes
